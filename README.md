# Quantum Chess

### The chess variant known as Quantum Chess. It allows the users to play embracing some of the principles of Quantum Mechanics.

Quantum Chess is a variant of the classical chess game adding some Quantum properties. In the game, sometimes pieces can be in two places at once, known as quantum superposition. This happens when you make a quantum move. Quantum moves are the result of two classical moves at once, so we no longer know the precise position of this piece. The piece's position is defined when an observation happens. In this case, when someone captures a quantum piece or when a quantum piece captures another. Then we have a 50% chance to be in each different position. This allows quantum entanglement. If a quantum piece has a certain probability to be at one place, it means that there is a probability that it is not there and I can pass through it with a slide move. In this case, the piece may have done the movement or not, it depends on the final position of the previous quantum piece. It is entangled. To win, you must capture the enemy king.

To write a move, write the UCI notation for the movement:

I.e. To move any piece from the square b5 to the square d3 write _'b5d3'_.
If you want to move it quantic, to d3 and e2 write _'b5d3, b5e2'_

Write _'Rules'_ to display the set of rules for Quantum Chess
Write _'Over'_ anytime to finish the game, or _'Reset'_ to restart it

You can use the Stockfish engine to help you move, rate your position, etc. Typing _'Evaluate'_, you will receive an evaluation of the current position, as a number that can be positive or negative. A higher number means white is winning, and lower (negative) numbers mean black is winning. Type _'Evaluate move'_, press __Enter__, and then introduce the move you want to evaluate to receive a number telling how good the move is. Type _'Hint'_ to ask Stockfish what to move in the current position.
